Homework03 Evaluation
======================
You MUST do problem 1, the "odd-even sort"

You MUST do EITHER problem 2, Huffman, OR problem 3, Simon.
Whichever one you choose is your option, but you must indicate
which one you choose.  If you want to do both of them, you will
be given extra credit for whatever points you get correct on
the second problem.  For example, if you choose to do Simon and
it is completely correct, and you do Huffman for extra credit
and get 5 out of 7 correct, you will get 136% for the assignment.
The extra points will be applied at the end of the semester to
improve your overall score for the course.

Assuming odd-even sort is correct, of course....

GREAT JOB on this assignment!

The sorting program works great.  Nice job on your testing philosophy with
multiple, well-marked tests!  I wonder where that extra zero is coming from
though...  :grin:  Not to worry, though, it's coming out at the front, so
it's being treated as the lowest value.  One thing to check next time is if
it works with NEGATIVE values as well as positives...

Your Simon game works very well!  A little investigation might help you to
uncover a way to move back over the user entry to cover that up, too!  That
gives you an extra challenge...

Unfortunately, Huffman doesn't give me enough output to know if it's really
working like you say it is.  Using my standard test string of "this is", I
see you got the string, and you are printing out the steps as you progress
through them, but you're not printing the result of each step so one can see
if the correct result is obtained.  Although that wasn't a requirement, it
is useful to track what's happening.  However, at the end, there is neither
an output of the encoded one-zero string, nor an output of the decoded text
that should match the original message.

Still you earned nearly maximum credit for that, so Extra Credit points for
you for the assignment!!

All in all, a worthy effort!  Keep up the good work!!
