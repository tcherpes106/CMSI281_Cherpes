I discovered that you had two different package names!

Your SourceFile.java and TargetFile.java are in a subdirectory which is named
"copier_support", but in the files you were saying the package name was
"copiersupport" which is the way it was spelled out in the problem statement.
That extra underscore was the killer!

You had the same situation in the MyFileCopier.java file, calling out the
package as "copiersupport" without the underscore.  I changed things to match
and it all works great!

Forgive the intrusion to make a text file for it to operate on in your repo.

Keep it up, guys!!
