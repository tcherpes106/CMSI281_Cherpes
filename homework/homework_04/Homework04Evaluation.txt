Notes:
======
Nice work on this assignment, as usual!

Although, kind of minimal on the first problem.  There's no main and not any
test code to make sure it works, but I can tell from the code that it's good.
There were supposed to be some tests to verify that the code produces proper
sequences, but I see that I just asked for a method.  My bad.  Your win.

PriorityQ works fine.

The combined hash functions work fine.  Nice work on the output, so that the
user can see exactly what is happening.  The linear probing works as expected
and the digit folding works fine.  It would be helpful to give the user some
information about HOW the digit folding is being done, but that wasn't asked
for in the problem.

Nice job, and a great finish to the semester!
